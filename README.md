# weather
This project I developed focused on enhancing my understanding of API implementation. In this project, I created a program that leverages the Open Weather API to fetch weather information for any specified location. The program was designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing individuals to easily obtain accurate and up-to-date weather data. After fetching the data, the program generates a text file that contains the output, making it easy for users to save and reference the information at a later time. This project allowed me to gain practical experience in API implementation, while also honing my programming skills.
